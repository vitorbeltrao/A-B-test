## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The idea of this project is to do an experiment using A/B testing to test whether or not a software company should change the homepage layout. In this project, we did:

* We scale the experiment and collect the necessary sample data.
* We check the significance of the invariant metric.
* We verified the significance of assessment metrics I and II (software download rate and software license rate, respectively).
* We did our prescriptive analysis.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 exploratory notebook available here to showcase work related to the above test A/B. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) for the data and idea. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
